# Todo List

## Intrduction

This file is dedicated to documenting all the tasks and exercises I would like to complete independent of the week. Each item is assigned a priority High (H), Medium (M), Low (L) as an indication to how important I think the item is to my progression

I will keep all todo items in the list as a reference to look back on.
