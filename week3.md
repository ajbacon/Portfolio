# Week 3

[Monday / Tuesday](#monday--tuesday) | [Monday / Tuesday](#wednesday--thursday) | [Friday](#friday)

A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals.

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------
## Weekly Goals

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

------
## Monday / Tuesday

**Goals**
- Study and understand the basics of how the web works
- Start building simple web application 

**Reflection and Evidence**
- Did some reading/research into the basics of web. Notes can be found [here](https://github.com/ajbacon/Portfolio/blob/master/course_notes/Internet.md)
- Used the afternoon pairing challenge to start building a web application

## Wednesday / Thursday

**Goals** 
- Understand and diagram the MVC pattern
- continue building simple web application
- Attend empathy workshop on Wednesday
- Attend debugging web apps workshop on Thursday

**Reflection and Evidence**
- Researched the MVP pattern with my notes [here](https://github.com/ajbacon/Portfolio/blob/master/course_notes/mvc_pattern.md)
- With morning worshops I spent most of my time familiarising myself with the afternoon challenge

## Friday / Weekend

**Goals** 
- Complete the battle challenge
- Complete the weekend challenge
- Write refections on the week and catch up with any notes

## Week Reflections

### Summary

This week was busy with workshops in the morning, which left very little time to complete any further learning exercises/practicals. However I was able to do some research into the basics of the web/internet and MVC pattern, writing some notes on both (links found above). I feel comfortable now with using ruby and organising code into classes hence it was good to be stretched further with adding the controller and views (front-end). We were introduced to Capybara, used to Feature Test interaction with the front-end, the premise and syntax is very similar to rspec used for unit testing, hence all the previous rspec TDD experience made this a much shallower learning curve. 

The weekend RPS challenge essentially went over the same content as the afternoon challenge, a good way to reinforce the learning of the week. Had a chance to play around with front-end and some CSS animations.

An important piece of advice was given during this weeks challenge, and that was not to use Global Variables **EVER!**


### What to do differently going forward

- I missed the documentation into RESTful routes, hence the afternoon challenge was not very RESTful. I must focus on RESTful routes in future
- Remember to keep views clean and controllers skinny (most of the gruntwork should be handled by the model)

### Knowledge gaps to work on

- More reading required on OO principles to gain fuller understanding, perhaps with some exercises.
- Keep working on mocks/doubles and dependency injection etc
