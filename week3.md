A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals.

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------
## Weekly Goals

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

------

## Week Reflections

### What processes/concepts/technologies do you think you've progressed on?`

- Have more knowledge on the how the internet works

### Summary

This week was busy with workshops in the morning, which left very little time to complete any further learning exercises/practicals. However I was able to do some research into the basics of the web/internet and MVC pattern, writing some notes on both (links found above). I feel comfortable now with using ruby and organising code into classes hence it was good to be stretched further with adding the controller and views (front-end). We were introduced to Capybara, used to Feature Test interaction with the front-end, the premise and syntax is very similar to rspec used for unit testing, hence all the previous rspec TDD experience made this a much shallower learning curve. 

The weekend RPS challenge essentially went over the same content as the afternoon challenge, a good way to reinforce the learning of the week. Had a chance to play around with front-end and some CSS animations.

An important piece of advice was given during this weeks challenge, and that was not to use Global Variables **EVER!**


### What to do differently going forward

- I missed the documentation into RESTful routes, hence the afternoon challenge was not very RESTful. I must 
- Remember to keep views clean and controllers skinny (most of the gruntwork should be handled by the model)
- Remember to test state rather than behaviour

### Knowledge gaps to work on

- More reading required on OO principles to gain fuller understanding, perhaps with some exercises.
- Keep working on mocks/doubles and dependency injection etc
