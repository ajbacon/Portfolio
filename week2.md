# Week 2

[Monday / Tuesday](#monday--tuesday) | [Wednesday / Thursday](#wednesday--thursday) | [Friday / Weekend](#friday--weekend)

A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals.

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------
## Weekly Goals

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

------
## Monday / Tuesday


**Goals**
- Study and understand the basic OO principles (SRP, encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance)
- Write more complete notes and keep track of progress/reflections
- Attend process workshop

**Reflection and Evidence**
- I conducted plenty of research into the fundamentals of OOP with notes posted [here](https://github.com/ajbacon/Portfolio/blob/master/course_notes/OO_programming_notes.md). 
- Polymorphism seems to be the most tricky concept to explain (easier to make code polymorphic than to explain!), hence I completed a polymorphism skill workshop to help understanding [here](https://github.com/ajbacon/makers_practicals/tree/master/oo_relationships)
- I attended the first available process workshop on the Monday, which I found to be very beneficial. It is an unusual experience to have someone watch over you while you code so the more practice I get at this, the better. 
- Finally, the fact that this document is available is evidence that I am making better notes are

## Wednesday / Thursday

**Goals** 
- Focus on rigidly sticking to the TDD process 
- Be comfortable with doubles/mocks/stubs and dependency injection to isolate class testing

**Reflection and Evidence**
- Used the oystercard challenge to focus on TDD. Solution [here](https://github.com/ajbacon/oystercard_challenge)
- Any useful notes and links to so with TDD are collated in this [link](https://github.com/ajbacon/Portfolio/blob/master/course_notes/TDD_notes.md)


## Friday / Weekend

- Complete the afternoon project (link) as best as possible
- More doubles/mocks/stubs and dependency injection practice
- Start the weekend challenge (as limited time at the weekend to complete)

**Reflection and Evidence**
- Didn't seem to get as far as i'd liked with understanding of doubles/mocks by friday afternoon 
- Used the quiet time alone doing the weekend challenge to really study and practice this aspect, which was really beneficial
- Managed to get all the user stories complete for the weekend challenge following a strict TDD process and using mocks/doubles/dependency injection to isoloate classes when testing. Enjoyed my first taste of using an API to send a text message confirmation of the order.

## Week Reflections

### Summary

Overall I was pleased with my progress on the ruby programming side of things, I feel I've managed to get comfortable with classes, making them work together and adhere to SRP. I've made good progress in understanding the basic pincipals of object-oriented programming which was one of my main aims of the week (although the act of ). The class extraction exercises within the Oystercard challenge were tricky to conceptualise at first, but by taking a step back from the code and using a pen and paper to diagram my thoughts I was able to move on and code/refactor my solution. 

The principles of OO are starting to hit home, more reading and practical experience is required, however I am at least now aware of the principles and much clearer in my mind what OOP is trying to achieve over other types of programming (eg procedural)

The TDD side of things were slightly more frustrating. I am comfortable with the process of TDD and the steps needed to be taken, but the syntax and use of doubles/mocks/stubs, even by Friday afternoon,was still something I hadn't grasped to my own level of satisfaction. However, having chance to take a step back and work on the weekend challenge on my own in a quiet place I was able to make good progress on how doubles/mocks/stubs work and their utility in isolating classes during testing. There are still holes in my knowledge, which I plan to address with a coach next week, but I finished the weekend in a much happier position than I started it.


### What to do differently going forward

- Try not to have sole focus on completing the challenges, and when necessary take a step back and read the documentation/ do research into a concept. 
- Remember to test state rather than behaviour

### Knowledge gaps to work on

- More reading required on OO principles to gain fuller understanding, perhaps with some exercises.
- Keep working on mocks/doubles dependency injection etc
