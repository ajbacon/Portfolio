# Week 2

[Monday / Tuesday](#Monday-/-Tuesday)

A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals.

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------
## Weekly Goals

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

------
## Monday / Tuesday

- **Goal**: Study and understand the basic OO principles (SRP, encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance)
- **Plan**: Work through the course material, make snd store notes
- **Evidence**: 

- **Goal**: Attend process workshop
- **Plan**: To attend first available session
- **Evidence**: Attended the first available workshop. 

`
## Wednesday / Thursday**

- **Goal** Be comfortable with doubles/mocks/stubs and dependency injection to isolate class testing
- **Plan** 

## Friday

## Reflections

### Summary

Overall I was pleased with my progress on the ruby programming side of things, I feel I've managed to get comfortable with classes, making them work together and adhere to SRP. I've made good progress in understanding the basic pincipals of object-oriented programming which was one of my main aims of the week. The class extraction exercises within the Oystercard challenge were tricky to conceptualise at first, but by taking a step back from the code and using a pen and paper to diagram my thoughts I was able to move on and code/refactor my solution. 

The principles of OO are starting to hit home, more reading and practical experience is required, however I am at least now aware of the principles.

The TDD side of things were slightly more frustrating. I was comfortable with the process of TDD and the steps needed to be taken, but the syntax and use of doubles/mocks/stubs, even by Friday afternoon, was still something I hadn't grasped to my own level of satisfaction. However, having chance to take a step back and work on the weekend challenge on my own in a quiet place I was able to make good progress on how doubles/mocks/stubs work and their utility in isolating classes during testing. There are still holes in my knowledge, which I plan to address with a coach next week, but I finished the weekend in a much happier position than I started it.


### What to do differently going forward

- Try not to have sole focus on completing the challenges, and when necessary take a step back and read the documentation. 
- Remember to test state rather than behaviour

### Knowledge gaps to work on

- More reading required on 
- Rs
